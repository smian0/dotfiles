### QMCO - Quantum Corp
**October 6 Price:** $11.65 | **Entry:** $10-11 | **Status:** ✅ WITHIN ZONE (high end)
**Distance:** At entry zone high (+6.5% from low)

**Data Age:** 4 days old - price may have moved significantly

#### October 6 Recommendation
**Conservative approach:** Wait for pullback to $10.00-10.50 (low-to-mid entry zone)
**Aggressive approach:** Enter 50% at $11.65, add 50% on dip to $10.00-10.50

#### **TODAY'S ACTION (October 10):**
1. ✅ **Check current price first** - If still $10-11, consider entry
2. ✅ **Check QMCO IR site** for legal updates daily
3. ✅ **Set alert at $10.50** (mid-entry zone)
4. ✅ **Set alert at $10.00** (entry zone low)

#### Intraday Strategy (IF still in zone)

- 🎯 **Target 1:** $13.00-13.50 (+10-15%)
- 💰 **Position Size:** 2-3% max (HIGH RISK due to legal issues)

**RSI (Oct 6):** 77-82 (EXTREME OVERBOUGHT) | **Risk:** HIGH | **Earnings:** Oct 23, 2025

#### **TODAY'S ACTION (October 10):**
**⚠️ EARNINGS RISK:** Earnings on **Oct 23** (13 days away) - extreme volatility ahead

1. **Check current price and RSI**

3. **If still above $4.60:** Wait for pullback or skip (too close to earnings)
4. **Set alert at $4.60** (entry zone high)
5. **Set alert at $4.10** (entry zone low)
