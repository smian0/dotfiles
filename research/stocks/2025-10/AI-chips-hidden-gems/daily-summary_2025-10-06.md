## 📝 Summary & Recommendations

### TLDR
No immediate entry opportunities. GSIT most likely to hit entry zone first ($4.55-4.60 in 1-2 weeks) but carries highest risk due to overbought RSI and Oct 23 earnings. AMBA and LSCC have 60-70% probability of testing entry zones in 2-4 weeks with lower risk. BRCHF untradeable due to extreme liquidity issues.

### What to Do Right Now

1. **Set Price Alerts:**
   - GSIT: $4.60, $4.55
   - AMBA: $82.00, $80.00
   - LSCC: $68.00, $66.00

2. **Prepare Entry Plans:**
   - GSIT: 50% position size (earnings risk), stop below $4.50 or $4.05
   - AMBA: Full position size, stop below $79-80
   - LSCC: Full position size, stop below $65

3. **Monitor Daily:**
   - GSIT RSI for exit from overbought territory
   - AMBA volume for pickup (need 700K+ for sustainability)
   - LSCC for routine pullbacks

4. **Avoid:**
   - Chasing current prices (all above entry zones)
   - BRCHF entirely (liquidity warning)

### Patient Capital Wins
All 4 stocks have high probability of testing entry zones in next 2-4 weeks. Be patient and wait for better entries rather than chasing current prices.
