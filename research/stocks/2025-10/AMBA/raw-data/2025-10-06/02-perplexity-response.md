## Response Summary (Auto-extracted from Perplexity)

Here's a focused swing-trading read on AMBA with current indicators, key levels, and what the tape suggests after the auto/edge-AI news flow.

AMBA's 14-day RSI sits in the high 50s and MACD is positive, while price holds above the 50-day and 200-day MAs; tactically, the $80–82 zone is immediate support and likely to be probed on routine pullbacks, but sustained retests depend on news/volume follow-through into the next earnings window late November 2025 per trackers.

## Full Response Text

### Momentum and oscillators

**RSI (14-day):** ~57–58, a neutral-to-bullish read indicating neither overbought nor oversold, consistent with a consolidating uptrend after a sharp run.

**MACD (12,26,9):** Positive and in "buy" territory; recent readings around 2.5–2.7 indicate momentum remains constructive above the signal line, though the slope has flattened with consolidation.

### Moving averages

**50-day MA:** ~75.1; price above this level, preserving intermediate uptrend support after the August–September surge.

**200-day MA:** ~65.5–66.0; the primary trend remains up with a sizable buffer to the 200-day, reflecting a regime shift post-earnings/guidance raise.

### Support and resistance

**Near-term support:** 82.2 / 81.2 / 80.3 cluster cited by swing scanners, aligning with the psychological $80–82 zone and lower Bollinger area; 50-day sits further below near 75.

**Resistance:** 84–86 band short-term, then the low-90s toward the 52-week high near 93–94 as the next supply layer.

### Will $80–82 be tested?

**Baseline:** Yes, it's a high-probability "check back" zone on routine pullbacks given proximity to recent value and scanner-derived supports, provided no new upside catalyst lands; volatility metrics and average true range suggest 3–4% daily ranges make a 2–4 point drift feasible in quiet tape.

**Counterpoint:** Auto "design wins" are more pipeline than immediate revenue; management and coverage emphasize auto acceleration skewed to 2027–2028, so the automotive headlines alone may not prevent tests of $80–82 absent fresh deal specifics or production ramps.

**Net:** Expect routine liquidity probes into $80–82 during consolidations unless incremental catalysts arrive; any decisive break-and-hold below 80 would shift focus to ~75 (50-day).

### Next earnings and catalysts

**Next earnings date:** Trackers peg late November 2025 (around Nov 25) based on cadence; official date not yet confirmed by the company.

**Upcoming catalysts:**

- Execution on raised FY26 guide (Q3 guide $100–108M, margin framework), and any upside preannouncements or analyst days.

- Edge-AI production updates (drone/edge infrastructure) and any concrete ADAS L2+/L3 passenger-car design win disclosures; Continental partnership remains a backdrop, with series production timelines in the 2025–2026 window for certain systems, while broader auto ramps skew later per management commentary.

### Volume and sustainability

**Average volume trend:** 20–100 day average volumes in the ~700k–900k range reflect elevated participation during the run-up; recent sessions show waning volume as price consolidates near mid-80s, typical of digestion phases after breakouts.

**Read:** The prior upward leg was well-sponsored by volume around earnings/guidance; current lighter volume during sideways action is constructive if price holds supports, but a sustained push through 86–90 likely requires renewed volume expansion tied to fresh news or bullish pre-earnings positioning.

**Tape risk:** If volume dries up further and momentum oscillators roll, a standard mean-revert into $80–82 is likely; failure there points to the 50-day near ~75 as a secondary test zone.

### Quick tactical take

**Bias:** Buy-the-dip into $80–82 with risk defined below $79–80, targeting a swing back into $86 then low-90s, contingent on volume expansion and stable market beta; avoid chasing if volume stays muted and MACD flattens or crosses down.

**Macro sensitivity:** With beta elevated versus SPY historically, broader market swings can amplify AMBA's pullbacks and rallies; watch sector tape into late November earnings season.
