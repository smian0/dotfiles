## Full Response Text

### 1. Current RSI (14-day) and MACD Readings

The 14-day RSI is around 68.87, approaching the overbought zone but not extreme yet, signaling potential caution or a near-term pullback possibility.

The MACD recently turned positive in early August 2025 and remains slightly positive, suggesting bullish momentum but with mild bearish divergence (-0.22 in recent reading), indicating some short-term weakness pressure.

### 2. Moving Averages (50-day, 200-day)

The 50-day moving average is near $63-$64, and the 200-day moving average is about $56-$57.

The stock price currently trades above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, with the 50-day recently crossing above the 200-day around late August 2025, a bullish golden cross signaling a potential sustained uptrend.

Moving averages score is positive for shorter periods but somewhat neutral to bearish on longer oscillators reflecting mixed sentiment.

### 3. Support and Resistance Levels

Key support levels are approximately between $65.00 and $65.75, with lower support at around $64.50.

Resistance is identified near $66.90 to $68.19, with some pivot points clustering in this zone suggesting a key battleground for the price.

The $66-68 zone is a significant resistance area, as noted in pivot points and resistance clustering.

### 4. Entry Zone $66-68 Likelihood Post-Analyst Upgrades

After several analyst upgrades and upbeat AI-driven momentum guidance, the recent strong demand in communications and compute segments driven by AI servers supports upside potential.

However, technical oscillators suggest possible pullback before a sustained breakout above $68.

Recent buyback activity at about $70.85 and optimistic guidance for revenue growth add fundamental support for testing or surpassing this zone.

### 5. Next Earnings Date and Upcoming Catalysts

Next earnings release is scheduled for November 3, 2025.

Key catalysts include ongoing normalization of inventory in Industrial and Automotive sectors, strong AI-related data center demand, accelerating new product design wins, and margin stability management amid tariffs.

These factors may drive momentum if execution continues as expected.

### 6. Volume Analysis and Sustainability of Upward Move

Average daily volume is around 2.8 million shares, indicating strong liquidity.

The stock has seen increased volume accompanying its recent upward move, supporting the price rally's sustainability.

However, some technical signals warn of a potential short-term pullback after recent overbought RSI and stochastic readings, suggesting traders should watch volume closely for confirmation of further advances.

## Summary Statement from Perplexity

In summary, LSCC shows a bullish technical structure with supportive moving averages and positive momentum after analyst upgrades and strong AI-driven fundamental catalysts. The $66-68 resistance will be a critical zone to test, with a likely pullback possible near-term due to nearing overbought RSI conditions and volume caution. The November 3 earnings and ongoing AI/data center growth are key upcoming drivers for swing traders to monitor closely.

This analysis provides a balanced outlook considering both technical and fundamental factors for LSCC swing trading.
