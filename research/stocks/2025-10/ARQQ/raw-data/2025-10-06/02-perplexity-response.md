## $62–65 entry zone

Price has not yet reached the $62–65 zone; intraday and recent highs topped out near 52–53, leaving the specified zone above current trading by a meaningful margin.

Given the steep two-week advance, a push into the low 60s would likely require additional positive catalysts or a momentum extension; current reference levels suggest resistance in the low 50s where price has paused.

## RSI and MACD

Short-term technical snapshots show an elevated 14‑day RSI around the high 70s to near 80 during the Oct 1–3 surge, consistent with overbought conditions into the current week; this is typical after a multi-session breakout and suggests digestion risk even within an uptrend.

MACD readings on third-party dashboards skew positive after the September breakout, with bullish momentum conditions flagged into October; a prior note cited positive MACD on multiple time frames, aligning with the recent trend.

## Earnings date and catalysts

Multiple trackers now estimate the next ARQQ earnings in December rather than mid‑November, with windows cited between Dec 10 and late December; one calendar lists Dec 10 and another a Dec 12–23 range, indicating no official date posted yet and a likely December timing shift.

**Source:** marketchameleon +2

Near-term catalysts include additional NetworkSecure customer wins, deployment updates, and any guidance commentary ahead of the next report; the recent Fabric Networks license is a concrete commercial milestone that could precede further enterprise or partner announcements.

## Key levels and positioning notes

Recent reference levels include a prior close near 49.92 (Oct 3) and intraday stretches toward 52.30, marking immediate resistance; a break-and-hold above low 50s could open room toward mid‑50s, while pullbacks toward mid‑40s would test the prior breakout area from late September.

Options and trader cheat sheets indicate overbought RSI conditions near 80 at ~50.8 price, reinforcing the case for near-term consolidation risk after the strong multi-session leg higher.
