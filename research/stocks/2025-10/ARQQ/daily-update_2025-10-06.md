**⚠️ RISK WARNING:** ARQQ is a high-risk, volatile quantum encryption penny stock with extreme price swings. Current overbought conditions (RSI near 80) significantly increase short-term downside risk. Only enter at predetermined entry zone ($42-45) with proper position sizing (2-3% max) and stop losses in place. Not suitable for risk-averse investors.
