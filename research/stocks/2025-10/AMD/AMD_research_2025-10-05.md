## Executive Summary

AMD is positioned for robust growth driven by AI/datacenter expansion, with Wall Street projecting $47-48B revenue by 2027 (17-18% CAGR) and operating margins expanding to 28-30%. The company has secured partnerships with 7 of the top 10 AI firms and is targeting 7-15% share of the $400B AI accelerator TAM by 2027. However, the stock trades at a significant valuation premium (P/E 99, 35-72% above DCF intrinsic value), faces intense competition from Nvidia/Intel/ARM, and remains exposed to China export controls and execution risks.

**Investment Thesis:** Cautiously bullish with high execution risk. Success hinges on Zen 6 CPU ramp (2026), MI400/500 AI GPU competitiveness, and achieving >7% AI market share. Current valuation prices in near-perfect execution.

## 10. Investment Recommendation

### Rating: **HOLD** (with conditional BUY on pullback to $140-150 range)

### Rationale

**Strengths:**
1. Strong positioning in AI/datacenter megatrend (7/10 top AI firms using Instinct)
2. Proven execution track record (EPYC share gains, client/gaming recovery)
3. Robust roadmap (Zen 6, MI400/500, mobile platforms)
4. Expanding TAM ($400B AI accelerators by 2027)
5. Margin expansion trajectory (22% → 28-30% by 2027)

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Valuation:** 35-72% above DCF intrinsic value, P/E 99 (trailing), 32.5 (forward)
2. **Competition:** Nvidia ecosystem lock-in, Intel recovery efforts, ARM custom silicon
3. **Execution Risk:** Zen 6/MI400 delays or performance shortfalls would be devastating
4. **China Exposure:** $800M Q2 impact, ongoing regulatory uncertainty
5. **Customer Concentration:** Hyperscaler dependence creates volatility

**Price Action Strategy:**
- **Current ($164):** Fairly valued to slightly overvalued, wait for better entry
- **Accumulation Zone:** $140-150 (near major support, ~15-20% pullback)
- **Profit-Taking Zone:** $180-200 (approaching bull case scenario)
- **Stop Loss:** $135 (breaks major support, invalidates bullish thesis)

### Position Sizing Guidance
- **Conservative:** 2-3% portfolio weight (high-growth/high-risk allocation)
- **Moderate:** 4-5% (if conviction on AI cycle + AMD execution)
- **Aggressive:** 6-8% (only if willing to ride 20-30% volatility around earnings/product launches)
