## 📊 Market Context

**Quantum Computing Sector:**
- Experienced "explosive rally" October 7-9, 2025
- Most stocks up 2000%+ year-to-date (RGTI +2042%, QUBT +1986%, QBTS +1758%)
- Sector showing signs of exhaustion (extreme RSI levels, massive volumes)
- **Historical pattern:** Parabolic rallies typically followed by 30-50% corrections

**Technical Environment:**
- Multiple stocks showing sell signals (MACD, RSI)
- Only QMCO showing mixed signals (MACD buy, RSI neutral)
- Volume spikes on RGTI (128M) and QBTS (66M) suggest climax behavior

**Macro Considerations:**
- No sector-specific news driving the Oct 7-9 rally
- Appears to be momentum/retail-driven rally
- ARQQ's preliminary results (Oct 9) were weak ($525-535K revenue)
- Fundamentals not supporting current valuations

## 📝 Summary & Recommendations

### TLDR

**🔴 ALL 7 quantum stocks are trading well above conservative entry zones (14-49% above targets). The sector experienced an explosive rally Oct 7-9 with extreme overbought conditions. RGTI shows the most dangerous setup (RSI 86, +40% above entry). Only QUBT is close to entry zone at $20.40 vs $18-21 target. DO NOT CHASE. Wait for pullbacks - better entries are coming.**

### What to Do Right Now

1. **Set Price Alerts:**
   - QUBT at $21.00 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - QMCO at $11.00
   - RGTI at $40.00 (correction alert)
   - IONQ at $65.00

2. **Prepare Entry Plans:**
   - QUBT: Enter at $18-20 if breaks $21 with volume + RSI < 40
   - QMCO: Enter at $10-11 if reaches zone with volume confirmation
   - OTHERS: Patient wait for 15-40% pullbacks

3. **Monitor Daily:**
   - QUBT price action (closest to entry)
   - RGTI for signs of reversal (RSI extremes can't last)
   - November earnings dates (4 stocks Nov 5-18)
   - Sector volume trends (watch for exhaustion)

4. **Avoid:**
   - **NEVER chase prices** above entry zones
   - Avoid RGTI completely until 30-40% correction
   - Avoid QSI (penny stock, unclear quantum positioning)
   - Do NOT FOMO into the quantum rally - it's extended

### Critical Takeaways

1. **Discipline is Key:** Entry zones exist for a reason - they represent value. Current prices represent speculation.

2. **Patience Will Be Rewarded:** Parabolic rallies always correct. The question is not "if" but "when."

3. **QUBT is the Only Near-Term Opportunity:** Focus monitoring efforts here.

4. **RGTI is a Trap:** RSI 86 + 40% above entry = disaster waiting to happen.

5. **November Earnings = Volatility:** 4 stocks reporting Nov 5-18. Could create entry opportunities.
