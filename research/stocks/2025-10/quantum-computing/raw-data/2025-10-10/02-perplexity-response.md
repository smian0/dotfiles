### Swing Trading Assessment

**Critical Warning**: All seven positions are trading well above entry zones, with RGTI showing the most extreme overbought conditions (RSI 86.11). The quantum sector experienced significant momentum October 7-9, but technical indicators suggest caution for new entries at current levels. Consider waiting for pullbacks toward target zones or establishing partial positions with tight stops given the extended nature of this rally.
