## Perplexity Response (Raw)

### Hidden Gem AI Stocks for October 2025

Several under-the-radar AI companies offer compelling risk-reward profiles with strong catalysts, though none approach the mega-cap valuations of Nvidia or Microsoft.

### Small-Cap Semiconductor & Infrastructure

**Amtech Systems (ASYS)** represents one of the most compelling small-cap plays in AI infrastructure. This semiconductor equipment maker supplies thermal processing, chemical-mechanical polishing, and advanced chip packaging tools critical for GPU and silicon carbide semiconductor production. The company posted Q3 fiscal 2025 revenue of $19.6 million, up 26% sequentially, with earnings of $0.06 per share versus a prior quarter loss of $0.16. AI-related equipment sales surged fivefold year-over-year, now representing approximately 25% of Thermal Processing Solutions revenue. Amtech earned a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with analysts revising estimates higher following Oracle's recent earnings report highlighting massive hyperscaler AI infrastructure demand.

**Applied Digital Corporation (APLD)** operates AI-optimized data centers and recently secured an $11 billion contracted lease revenue commitment through its CoreWeave partnership expansion. The stock has a market capitalization of approximately $7.2 billion and surged 143% in the most recent quarter, with shares hitting 52-week highs at $25.61 in September. Analysts project 47% annual revenue growth with margin expansion potential as data center projects scale. The company reports Q1 fiscal 2026 results on October 9, 2025, providing a near-term catalyst.

### Quantum Computing Pure Plays

**IonQ (IONQ)** leads the trapped-ion quantum computing sector with a market cap of approximately $12.3 billion and shares up 31.51% year-to-date. The company recently raised $1 billion in equity funding, bringing its cash position to roughly $1.6 billion. IonQ beat Q2 2025 expectations and the Zacks Consensus Estimate projects 2025 revenue growth of 97.3% year-over-year. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio stands at 98.14.

**Rigetti Computing (RGTI)** has surged 1,116.4% over the past year and trades at a market cap near $5 billion. The stock gained 24.8% year-to-date with quantum chipset development milestones serving as key catalysts. However, Rigetti's forward P/S ratio of 236.36 reflects extreme growth expectations, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate projects an 18.6% year-over-year revenue decline for 2025.

### AI Application Layer

**SoundHound AI (SOUN)** provides voice AI technology and shows -1.99% year-to-date performance but remains a watchlist candidate for traders focused on AI voice recognition. The company targets automotive and enterprise customer service applications.

**Freshworks (FRSH)** offers a SaaS platform with Freddy AI features designed for small and midsize businesses, serving over 68,000 global customers. The company delivers mid-teens revenue growth with improving margins, though profitability remains negative.

**PagerDuty (PD)** operates a DevOps and IT incident management platform with AI-driven automation tools that reduce incident response times, providing measurable ROI for enterprise buyers. The platform handles complex technical operations across thousands of enterprises.

### Emerging Opportunities

**Innodata (INOD)** provides data engineering and AI training datasets for large enterprises, positioning it as a hidden infrastructure beneficiary of AI adoption. The niche data services segment should see demand growth as model training requirements expand.

**Oscar Health (OSCR)** launched a Superagent AI assistant targeting healthcare insurance administrative cost reduction in a notoriously inefficient industry. The tech-enabled health insurer applies AI to member and provider interactions.

**Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)** maintains a $2 billion market cap and uses AI with massive proprietary datasets for drug discovery acceleration, backed by a supercomputer-scale Nvidia partnership. Success in clinical trials would validate the AI-driven therapeutics approach.

### Key Investment Considerations

These stocks span market caps from under $2 billion to $12 billion, with valuation multiples reflecting varying degrees of speculation versus established revenue. Small-cap semiconductor equipment plays like Amtech and infrastructure providers like Applied Digital offer exposure to AI buildout spending without direct competition against Nvidia or AMD. Quantum computing stocks carry extreme volatility but provide pure-play exposure to a potentially transformative technology. Application layer companies apply existing AI to solve specific vertical problems, creating defensible niches with lower technical risk than foundation model builders.
