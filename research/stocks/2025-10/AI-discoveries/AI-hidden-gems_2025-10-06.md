## 🚫 Tier 3: Disqualified (Market Cap Exceeded)

### RGTI - Rigetti Computing

- Stock Performance: Up 4,000% past year
- Cash Position: $571M, no debt
- Recent Milestone: 36-qubit processor (99.5% gate fidelity)

**Assessment:** Quantum computing pure play, highly speculative. May be worth monitoring if market cap falls below $5B, but current valuation is extreme.

---

**Reason for Disqualification:** Borderline too large, plus red flags

**Red Flags:**
- 7 analysts with consensus **Sell rating**
