## Summary

QMCO is trading around the low $11s in early trading on October 6, 2025, after a sharp rally last week; intraday action shows a fade off Friday's spike with ranges tightening, no touch of the $42–45 zone, and technicals remain moderately overbought but constructive into an expected November earnings window barring headline risk from ongoing legal notices.

## Price and intraday action

## News in past 24–48 hours

Legal update: A GlobeNewswire post from Rosen Law Firm on Oct 6 reminds Quantum investors about an upcoming deadline tied to a securities class action, keeping legal overhang in focus and potentially contributing to intraday volatility.

**Source:** globenewswire

Sector backdrop: Broader quantum headlines today center on capital raises and state policy initiatives in the quantum ecosystem, which can influence sentiment but are not issuer-specific to Quantum Corporation.

## $42–45 entry zone

**NOTE:** Query contained incorrect entry zone. QMCO's entry zone is $10-11, not $42-45.

Price has not reached the $42–45 zone; current trading in the low $11s is far below that range, and there is no recent evidence of tests anywhere near those levels in September–October data.

**Source:** stockanalysis +2

Over the past 30–90 days, historical quotes show highs in the low teens, reinforcing that $42–45 remains well above prevailing prices and would require a multi-bagger move from recent levels.

## RSI and MACD

Technical dashboards show RSI(14) hovering in the high 50s to low 60s recently, indicating neutral-to-bullish momentum rather than extreme overbought; this aligns with a constructive but cooling momentum profile after last week's spike.

**Source:** tipranks +1

MACD readings remain positive but not extreme on several trackers, consistent with an uptrend that may be entering a digestion phase; directional bias is modestly bullish while awaiting new catalysts.

## Earnings date and catalysts

Multiple earnings calendars still point to an estimated next report/call around Wednesday, November 12, 2025, with some trackers bracketing the window in the first half of November; no confirmed shift to November 8 appears on major calendars this morning.

**Source:** marketbeat +2

Potential catalysts include resolution or updates on legal matters, customer wins in data protection/tape library solutions, and follow-ups to recent product validations that have featured in prior coverage of Quantum's portfolio.

## Positioning context

Momentum support: The break above $10 last week and hold near $11 suggests improving short-term trend, but the legal headline risk and a still-fragile longer-term technical structure argue for disciplined risk management into earnings season.

**Source:** investors.quantum +1

What to watch: Confirm official earnings date on the investor site, monitor any additional class-action or restatement updates, and track whether RSI stays in the 55–65 band while MACD remains positive as a signal of constructive consolidation versus reversal.
