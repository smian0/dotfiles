**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:** QMCO has ongoing securities class action lawsuit. This creates headline risk and potential for sudden price gaps. Only enter with strict stop losses and appropriate position sizing (2-3% max). Not suitable for risk-averse investors. Monitor QMCO IR site daily for legal updates.

**📌 KEY INSIGHT:** This is the ONLY stock in the quantum portfolio currently at entry zone. IONQ and ARQQ are both 10-20% above their entry zones and overbought. QMCO offers the best immediate risk/reward IF legal risk is manageable.
