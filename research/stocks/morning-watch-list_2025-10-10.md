## 📊 Tier 1: IMMEDIATE WATCH (Next 1-7 Days)

### **QUBT** - Quantum Computing Inc. | $20.40 | Tier 1A
**Entry Zone:** $18-21 | **Distance:** AT UPPER BOUND (just above entry)
**Priority:** 🔥🔥🔥 HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Why Tier 1:**
- Only stock across both portfolios near entry zone
- Currently $20.40, just above $21 entry zone high
- Weak technicals (RSI 42.70, MACD bearish) suggest further weakness
- Earnings Nov 5 could create volatility window

**Action Plan:**
1. **ALERT:** Set price alert at $21.00
2. **ENTRY TRIGGER:** Break below $21 with volume + RSI < 40
3. **ENTRY RANGE:** $18.00-20.00 (be patient for lower end)
4. **POSITION SIZE:** 50% at $20, 50% at $18-19 if available
5. **STOP LOSS:** $17.00 (below entry zone)
6. **TARGET 1:** $24.00 (15-20% gain, take 50% profit)
7. **TARGET 2:** $28.00 (trail stop for remainder)

**Risks:**
- Earnings Nov 5 = high volatility
- Conflicting earnings dates (also listed as Nov 10-19) - VERIFY
- Quantum sector overall very extended
- Could gap down on sector weakness

**Timeframe:** 1-7 days (could hit entry zone this week)

- Pulled back -2.4% on Oct 9 (showing weakness)
- RSI 47.29 (neutral, room to fall)
- MACD 0.147 (Buy signal - mixed with price action)

**Action Plan:**
1. **ALERT:** Set at $11.00
2. **ENTRY:** $10.00-10.50 range
3. **CONFIRMATION:** Volume above 2M shares on entry day

## 📝 Key Takeaways & Strategy

### The Big Picture

**PATIENCE IS YOUR EDGE RIGHT NOW**

The quantum sector just had an explosive rally (Oct 7-9). Stocks are 14-49% above conservative entry zones. This is NOT the time to chase. History shows parabolic rallies correct 30-50%.

**The Setup:**
- Early November earnings (6 stocks) will create volatility
- Volatility = opportunity for patient traders
- Better entries are coming - don't force trades

### The Only Opportunity Today

**QUBT at $20.40** is the ONLY stock within reasonable distance of entry. But even here, patience pays:
- Wait for break below $21
- Confirm with volume
- Enter at $18-20, not $20.40

### What Success Looks Like

**Week 1-2:**
- QUBT entry at $18-20 ✅
- QMCO entry if drops to $10-11 ✅
- Fresh AI chips data gathered ✅
- All alerts set ✅

**Week 3-4 (Post-Nov-5-Earnings):**
- IONQ entry if corrects to $62-65
- LSCC entry at $66-68 (if data confirms opportunity)
- Position sizes kept to 3-5% max

**Week 5-8:**
- AMBA entry at $80-82
- Additional quantum plays if sector corrects

### What Failure Looks Like

**❌ Chasing RGTI at $47 (40% above entry)**
**❌ Entering QUBT at $23 because "it's going up"**
**❌ Buying BRCHF despite liquidity warnings**
**❌ Ignoring stop losses when trades go against you**

---

## 🔄 Data Refresh Schedule

**Next Update:** October 11, 2025 (Tomorrow)
**Focus:**
1. AI chips fresh pricing (LSCC, AMBA, GSIT, BRCHF)
2. QUBT intraday movement
3. Any quantum sector correction signals

**Critical Updates:**
- Daily for QUBT (Tier 1 watch)
- 2-3x weekly for all others
- Immediately after earnings announcements
- If RGTI shows reversal (RSI < 70)
