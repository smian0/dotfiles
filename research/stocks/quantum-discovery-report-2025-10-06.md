2. **Track Infrastructure Growth:** Monitor quarterly earnings for FORM and SKYT quantum segment revenue
3. **Watch Micro Cap Liquidity:** FEIM and MVIS have adequate volume but require position sizing discipline
4. **Consider Sell Discipline:** If mega-cap quantum offerings emerge (MSFT/GOOG/AMZN quantum cloud), reassess pure-play concentration

## Conclusion

The publicly traded quantum computing ecosystem is **highly concentrated** with fewer than 10 pure-play stocks globally. The user's existing portfolio comprehensively covers all major publicly traded quantum computing companies.

**New opportunities** discovered focus on **quantum infrastructure** - companies supplying critical testing equipment (FORM), chip fabrication (SKYT), and quantum sensors (FEIM). These represent different exposure points along the quantum value chain and provide diversification beyond pure-play quantum computing companies.

The **best pure-play quantum opportunities** (QuEra $1B+, PsiQuantum $7B, Classiq $0.5-1B) remain private but are expected to IPO in 2026, presenting future portfolio expansion opportunities.
