# OpenSkills Integration

You have access to specialized skills through the OpenSkills system, which brings Claude Code's skill system to Cursor IDE.

## Available Skills

Check `AGENTS.md` in the project root for the full list of available skills and their descriptions.

## How to Use Skills

When you need specialized functionality (research, PDF analysis, MCP server creation, brainstorming, TDD, etc.):

### Method 1: Read AGENTS.md First
1. Check `AGENTS.md` to see available skills
2. Read the skill file directly: `.agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

### Method 2: CLI Approach (if terminal access available)
```bash
# List available skills
openskills list

# Load a skill
openskills read <skill-name>
```

### Method 3: Direct File Access
Use the Read tool to load: `.agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

## Skill Structure

Skills follow Claude Code's format and are located in `.agent/skills/`:

```
.agent/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions with YAML frontmatter
├── references/        # Documentation files (loaded on demand)
├── scripts/          # Helper scripts
└── assets/           # Templates and configs
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use progressive disclosure - full instructions load only when invoked, keeping your context window clean. This is especially important in Cursor where context management differs from Claude Code.

## When to Use Skills

Skills provide proven workflows for complex tasks. Check AGENTS.md and consider using a skill when:

- You need structured research with source grounding
- Working with PDFs that require PII redaction
- Creating MCP servers or AI agents
- Implementing features with TDD workflow
- Debugging complex issues systematically
- Brainstorming and refining ideas
- Code review before merging
- Writing documentation or skills themselves

## Difference from Claude Code

**Claude Code**: Has native `Skill` tool that auto-loads skills based on context

**Cursor + OpenSkills**: Requires explicit skill loading via file reading or CLI

This is intentional - it gives you control over when skills are loaded into context.
