# Scripts

Automation scripts for managing the Claude Code OAuth Action.

## OAuth Token Generation

### quick-token.js

Interactive utility for generating Claude OAuth tokens locally:

```bash
# Generate login URL
bun run generate-token
# or
bun run oauth

# Exchange authorization code for tokens
bun run generate-token <auth_code>
# or
bun run oauth <auth_code>
```

### generate-token.sh

Bash script version with interactive prompts:

```bash
./scripts/generate-token.sh
```

Both utilities will:
1. Generate an OAuth login URL
2. Guide you through the browser authentication process  
3. Exchange the authorization code for access/refresh tokens
4. Save credentials to `credentials.json`

### Manual Usage

You can also use the core functionality directly:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate login URL
bun run index.ts

# Step 2: Exchange code for tokens (after browser auth)
bun run index.ts <authorization_code>
```

## update-v1-release.sh

Automatically updates the `v1` release to point to the latest commit on the `main` branch.

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/update-v1-release.sh
```

### What it does

1. **Switches to main branch** (if not already on it)
2. **Pulls latest changes** from origin/main
3. **Validates working directory** is clean
4. **Deletes existing v1 tag** (local and remote)
5. **Deletes existing GitHub release** v1
6. **Creates new v1 tag** pointing to latest commit
7. **Pushes v1 tag** to remote
8. **Creates new GitHub release** with updated notes

### Requirements

- `git` - For tag and repository management
- `gh` - GitHub CLI for release management
- Write access to the repository
- Clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)

### Safety Features

- Validates you're on the main branch
- Checks for clean working directory
- Handles missing tags/releases gracefully
- Provides detailed output for debugging
- Exits on any error to prevent partial updates

This ensures the v1 release always points to the latest, tested code from main branch.
