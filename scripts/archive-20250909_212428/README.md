## Summary

This archive contains artifacts from the scripts directory reorganization that:
1. Organized 20+ scripts into logical subdirectories (security, system, claude, mcp)
2. Fixed broken paths after moving scripts to subdirectories  
3. Removed deprecated scripts
4. Maintained backward compatibility via symlinks

The reorganization was completed successfully and all scripts are now functional.

## Archive Safety

These files are safe to delete if disk space is needed:
- Backup files are duplicates of working scripts
- Reorganization scripts served their purpose
- Documentation is preserved in git history

The archive is kept for reference and potential future debugging.
