# Research Stream 1: Xero Supplier Credit Allocation & Application
**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Research Angle:** Credit allocation and application for overpayments in Xero
**Status:** RESEARCH REQUIRED - CANNOT PROCEED

## Issue
I don't have access to web search tools in the current context. The research requires:

1. **WebSearch capability** to execute multiple queries
2. **Access to live web results** from Xero Central, accounting forums, and tutorial sites
3. **Ability to verify source credibility** and publication dates

## Recommended Approach

You should either:

### Option A: Use Claude Code with Web Search
If you're in Claude Code, you can enable web search tools and I can conduct comprehensive research with:
- 8+ search queries with different angles
- Source diversity (official docs + community resources)
- Credibility assessment (A/B/C tiers)
- 10-20 documented sources

### Option B: Manual Research Guide
I can provide you with a detailed research guide including:
- Exact search queries to run
- Sources to prioritize
- Information to extract
- How to evaluate credit allocation workflows

### Option C: Use Existing Knowledge (Limited)
I can provide general guidance on Xero credit management based on my training data (January 2025 cutoff), but this won't include:
- Latest Xero interface changes
- Recent best practices updates
- Community-sourced tips and workarounds
- Verification of current workflows

## What I Can Do Right Now

Without web search access, I can:
1. Explain general Xero credit note concepts from my knowledge
2. Outline typical credit allocation workflows
3. Identify potential approaches to research this topic
4. Create a structured research plan for you to execute

**Which approach would you prefer?**
