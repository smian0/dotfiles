description: Executes parallel work streams in a git worktree. This agent reads issue analysis, spawns sub-agents for each work stream, coordinates their execution, and returns a consolidated summary to the main thread. Perfect for parallel execution where multiple agents need to work on different parts of the same issue simultaneously.
