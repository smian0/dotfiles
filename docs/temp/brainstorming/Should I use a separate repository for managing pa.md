# Should I use a separate repository for managing passwords? Is that the best practice?

**Yes,** using a separate Git repository for managing your `pass` (password-store) database is strongly considered best practice among developers and security professionals.

***

## Why Use a Separate Repository for Your Password Store?

**1. Security \& Access Control**

- Your dotfiles repository is often public or shared with collaborators.
- Your password repo should be **private**, and its access tightly controlled.
- Even if both are private, separating them limits accidental disclosure and simplifies audit \& permissions management.

**2. Audit Trail \& Granular History**

- Git maintains an audit trail. Keeping password changes/history confined to a dedicated repo avoids unnecessary versioning signal/noise in your config history.

**3. Portability**

- You can clone your password repository only to machines that actually need secrets, versus all machines that consume non-sensitive dotfiles.

**4. Minimal Risk of Accidental Exposure**

- Youâ€™re less likely to accidentally push passwords to a public place if the password-store is simply never in your main dotfiles repo.

**5. Encourages Better Workflow**

- You can initialize, push, and sync one (`~/.password-store`) without interacting with your main dotfiles repo.
- This makes automated backups, restores, and rotations cleaner and more focused.

***

## Typical Setup

- **Dotfiles Repo:** Contains everything *except* the `~/.password-store` directory.
- **Password-store Repo:** Dedicated, private repo for Git-crypt, GPG, or `pass`-encrypted secrets.

Add to your main dotfiles `.gitignore`:

```
/.password-store
```


***

## Advanced: Using Git Submodules

If you want to automate the setup:

- Point to the password-store repo as a git **submodule** inside your dotfiles (`~/.dotfiles/password-store`).
- Then symlink or copy it to `~/.password-store` in your install script.

### Summary Table

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Separate password-store repo | Maximum security, simplest access control | One extra repo to manage/sync |
| Dotfiles+passwords (same repo) | Easier setup | Major risk if repo is shared/public |
| Submodule password-store | Easy bootstrap, keeps repos separate | Slightly more complex initial setup |


***

**In summary:**
Always use a completely separate, private repo for your password-store if you want professional-grade security, auditability, and maintainability.
Never bundle secrets with code/configs.
