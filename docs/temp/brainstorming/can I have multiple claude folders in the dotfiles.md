# can I have multiple claude folders in the dotfiles repo so I can have versions or ab tests of different claude settings?

Yes, you can absolutely maintain multiple `claude` configuration sets in your dotfiles repository to enable versioning, AB testing, or “profiles” for your Claude Code CLI setup. This is a common advanced dotfiles pattern—often called “package branches,” “flavors,” or “environments.”

***

### How to Organize Multiple Claude Folders for Versions/AB Testing

#### **1. Structure Your Dotfiles Repo**

You might use a directory naming convention to separate Claude setups:

```
~/.dotfiles/
├── claude-default/
│   └── .claude/      # Your baseline or default Claude config
│       └── settings.json
├── claude-backtest/
│   └── .claude/      # AB test or experimental settings
│       └── settings.json
├── claude-team/
│   └── .claude/      # Team/project-shared Claude config
│       └── settings.json
└── ... (other packages)
```

You can also have versions like `claude-v1/`, `claude-v2/`, etc.

***

#### **2. Stow Only the Active Configuration**

Symlinks created by STOW can only point to one target at a time.
To activate a config, just stow that package:

```bash
# Activate your default config
stow -D claude-backtest claude-team       # De-stow other variants
stow claude-default

# Later, switch to backtest settings
stow -D claude-default
stow claude-backtest
```

This process will update your `~/.claude/` symlink to point to the active version.

***

#### **3. Best Practices**

- **Name clearly** for each folder’s purpose or version.
- Use only one active Claude setup at a time (per user account).
- Document each config’s intent in a `README.md`.
- Consider script automation for frequent switching.

***

#### **4. Advanced: Layered or Hybrid Stowing**

If you want to share some settings (e.g., common commands across configs), you can keep a `claude-common/`:

- Stow both `claude-common` and a chosen variant (`claude-backtest`) to combine symlinks.

***

#### **5. Version Control and Collaboration**

- Store all your configs together—committed and versioned in git.
- Optionally, use git branches for truly independent environments, but folders are easier for side-by-side experimentation.

***

### Limitations

- Only one set of symlinks can “own” any given path (e.g., `~/.claude/`).
- You must de-stow or unlink the old config before activating another, or you’ll face link conflicts.
- Automated switching scripts help minimize manual steps.

***

### **Summary Table**

| Method | Config Usage | Best For |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Folder-per-config | `claude-backtest/`, `claude-team/`, etc. | Fast context switches, AB testing |
| Layered stowing | `claude-common/` + variant folder | Shared commands/agents + unique tweaks |
| Git branches | Different environments via git branch | Isolated historical states |


***

**Bottom line:**
This approach lets you experiment freely and maintain full reproducibility with your Claude CLI setups—all with robust versioning and minimal manual friction.
