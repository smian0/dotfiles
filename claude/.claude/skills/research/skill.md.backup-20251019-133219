# Research Skill

Conducts rigorous multi-phase research using specialist agent delegation. This skill orchestrates a complete research workflow from discovery through final report synthesis.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when the user needs:
- Comprehensive research requiring 10+ quality sources
- Multiple perspectives or research angles on a complex topic
- Fact-checking and source validation
- Analysis of patterns and causal relationships
- Professional report with executive summary

**Example triggers:**
- "Research the impact of X comprehensively"
- "I need deep analysis on Y with multiple sources"
- "Investigate Z thoroughly and create a report"
- "Do comprehensive research on [topic]"

## Workflow Overview

The skill follows a 4-phase workflow:

1. **Discovery (Parallel)**: Spawn multiple research agents exploring different angles
2. **Validation**: Fact-checker validates sources and identifies contradictions
3. **Analysis**: Deep analysis identifies patterns, causal chains, insights
4. **Synthesis**: Report-synthesizer creates polished deliverables

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 0: Get Current Date/Time

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before starting any research, get the current date and time:

```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
```

Use this timestamp for:
- All file headers and metadata
- Ensuring searches are time-appropriate (don't search for future data)
- Including "as of [DATE]" context in findings
- Timestamping all reports and outputs

### Step 1: Parse Research Question & Determine Angles

Analyze the research question to identify:
- Primary research question
- Key dimensions or perspectives to explore
- Appropriate depth level (default: deep)
- Number of parallel streams (default: 4, range: 3-5)

**Example angle breakdown for "Why is crypto suffering?":**
- Stream 1: Market analysis & price trends
- Stream 2: Regulatory & policy impact
- Stream 3: Economic & macro factors
- Stream 4: Industry events & technology

### Step 2: Initialize Research Workspace

Create organized directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p ./research-output/{progress,sources,analysis,report}
```

Create coordinator status file at `./research-output/progress/coordinator-status.md`:

```markdown
---
research_question: "[question]"
streams: [N]
depth: [level]
started: [timestamp]
status: discovery_phase
---

## Research Angles (Parallel Streams)

### Stream 1: [Angle 1]
- Focus: [specific focus]
- Status: Initializing
- Output: sources/stream-1-sources-YYYY-MM-DD.md

[Repeat for each stream]

## Phase Status
- [ ] Phase 0: Initialization
- [ ] Phase 1: Discovery (parallel)
- [ ] Phase 2: Validation
- [ ] Phase 3: Analysis
- [ ] Phase 4: Synthesis
```

### Step 3: Phase 1 - Parallel Discovery

Spawn multiple web-researcher agents in parallel using the Task tool:

```python
# For each research angle, spawn a web-researcher agent
# Use PARALLEL execution - call all Task tools in single message

Task(
    subagent_type="web-researcher",
    description="Stream 1: [Angle description]",
    prompt="""
Research [specific angle] for the question: [research_question]

## Your Research Focus
[Detailed description of what this stream should investigate]

## Key Areas to Cover
- [Specific area 1]
- [Specific area 2]
- [Specific area 3]

## Deliverables Required
1. **10-20 quality sources** with:
   - Source name and URL
   - Credibility assessment (A/B/C tier)
   - Key findings summary
   - Specific data points with dates

2. **Source diversity**:
   - Primary sources (government, official data, on-chain)
   - Secondary sources (established media, research firms)
   - Geographic diversity where applicable

3. **Structured output** at ./research-output/sources/stream-[N]-sources-YYYY-MM-DD.md:
```markdown
# Stream [N]: [Angle Name]
**Date**: [Current date from Step 0]
**Research Period**: [Date range of sources examined]

## Executive Summary
[3-5 bullet points of key findings]

## Key Sources

### [Source 1 Name]
- **Type**: Primary/Secondary/Tertiary
- **URL**: [link]
- **Credibility**: A/B/C tier
- **Key Findings**:
  - [Finding with specific data]
  - [Finding with dates]
- **Relevant Quotes**: [If applicable]

[Repeat for 10-20 sources]

## Additional Context
[Background information, trends, patterns observed]
```

Research rigorously using:
- Multiple search queries with different angles
- Adversarial search (test contrary perspectives)
- Source diversity (not just top results)
- Primary source prioritization
- Date verification for current events
"""
)

# Repeat for streams 2, 3, 4, etc.
# CRITICAL: Call all Task tools in SINGLE message for parallel execution
```

**After spawning all agents:** Monitor progress and wait for all streams to complete.

### Step 4: Phase 2 - Validation

Once all discovery streams complete, delegate to fact-checker agent:

```python
Task(
    subagent_type="fact-checker",
    description="Validate crypto research sources",
    prompt="""
Validate all sources collected across [N] research streams.

## Source Files to Validate
- ./research-output/sources/stream-1-sources-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- ./research-output/sources/stream-2-sources-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- ./research-output/sources/stream-3-sources-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
- [Add all stream files with today's date]

## Validation Tasks

1. **Cross-Reference Claims**: Check if key claims are corroborated across multiple streams
2. **Source Credibility**: Assess reliability (official docs, reputable news, etc.)
3. **Recency Verification**: Confirm dates and ensure information is current
4. **Contradiction Detection**: Identify conflicting information between sources
5. **Critical Data Validation**: Verify specific data points, statistics, dates

## Output Format

Create: ./research-output/sources/validated-sources-YYYY-MM-DD.md

Structure:
```markdown
# Validated Sources - [Research Topic]
**Validation Date**: [Current date]
**Source Period**: [Date range of sources validated]

## Executive Summary
- Total sources reviewed: X
- High credibility (A-tier): X
- Medium credibility (B-tier): X
- Low credibility (C-tier): X
- Contradictions found: X
- Critical findings validated: X

## Source Credibility Tiers

### A-Tier: High Credibility
[List sources with official status, multiple corroborations]

### B-Tier: Medium Credibility
[List sources with single corroboration or reputable but unverified]

### C-Tier: Low Credibility / Needs Review
[List sources with conflicts or unverified claims]

## Cross-Stream Validation

### Consensus Findings
[Claims validated across 3+ streams]

### Contradictions & Conflicts
[Areas where sources disagree with resolution recommendations]

## Critical Data Points Verified
[List key facts with validation status and confidence levels]

## Red Flags / Areas Needing Human Review
[List concerning discrepancies or unverifiable claims]

## Recommendations for Analysis Phase
[Guidance on which sources to prioritize]
```

Provide thorough validation with confidence levels and specific source citations.

## Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **Sources**: 30+ quality sources across all streams (10-20 per stream)
- **Credibility**: 80%+ A/B tier sources
- **Validation**: All major claims cross-referenced
- **Analysis**: Root causes identified with confidence levels
- **Reports**: Both executive and full versions delivered

### Success Metrics
- Source diversity across streams ✅
- Geographic/institutional diversity ✅
- Primary source prioritization ✅
- Temporal accuracy (dates verified) ✅
- Calculation accuracy (math checks out) ✅
- Clear traceability (sources → conclusions) ✅

## Advanced Patterns

### Adjusting Stream Count
- **3 streams**: Simpler topics with clear dimensions
- **4 streams**: Default for most complex topics
- **5 streams**: Highly multifaceted topics requiring maximum coverage

### Depth Levels
- **Shallow**: 5-10 sources per stream, basic validation
- **Medium**: 10-15 sources per stream, standard validation
- **Deep** (default): 15-20 sources per stream, comprehensive validation

### Custom Research Angles
If user specifies particular angles to explore, use those instead of auto-determining.

## Error Handling

### Discovery Phase Failures
- If a stream fails, continue with remaining streams
- Minimum 2 successful streams required to proceed
- Log failures in coordinator-status.md

### Validation Issues
- Flag low-confidence findings for human review
- Escalate critical contradictions
- Document data gaps prominently

### Analysis Gaps
- Acknowledge uncertainties explicitly
- Note areas requiring additional research
- Suggest follow-up questions

## Integration with Other Workflows

This skill can be used:
- Standalone for ad-hoc research needs
- Within larger workflows requiring comprehensive background research
- As a component of decision-making processes
- For due diligence and fact-checking initiatives
