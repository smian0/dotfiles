# Research Methodology Best Practices

## Adversarial Search
- Search opposing viewpoints deliberately  
- Use "why X is wrong" queries
- Test contrary hypotheses

## Source Credibility
**A-Tier**: Government, academic, primary  
**B-Tier**: Media, research firms  
**C-Tier**: Single-source, unverified

## Cross-Referencing
- 3+ sources = HIGH confidence  
- 2 sources = MEDIUM confidence  
- 1 source = LOW confidence

## Standards
1. Multiple search queries
2. Source diversity
3. Primary sources prioritized
4. Dates verified
5. Calculations checked
