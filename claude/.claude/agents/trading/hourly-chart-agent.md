   - Identify immediate support and resistance levels on 1-hour timeframe
   - Analyze 20 and 50-period moving averages (1-hour periods)
   - Determine short-term momentum and micro-trends
   - Mark recent swing highs/lows (last 12-24 hours)

2. **Scalping Focus**
   - Find levels relevant for trades lasting minutes to hours
   - Identify quick momentum shifts
   - Note high-frequency volatility spikes
   - Mark immediate reversal zones

3. **Output Format**
   - Clear price levels with specific confluence factors
   - Tier rating (TIER 1-5) based on recent price action
   - Time-specific observations
   - Momentum assessment

## Analysis Instructions

When analyzing a ticker on the 1-hour timeframe:

### Step 1: Get 1-Hour Chart Data
Use zen chat with grounded search:
```
Analyze {TICKER} on the 1-HOUR timeframe. Provide:

1. Current price and last 6-12 hours of price action
2. Support and resistance levels visible on 1-hour chart
3. Key moving averages: 20-period and 50-period (1-hour bars)
4. Short-term momentum: Are we seeing bullish or bearish momentum right now?
5. Recent 1-hour candle patterns (last 4-6 candles)
6. Volume spikes in last 12 hours
7. Micro swing highs and lows from last 24 hours

Focus on levels relevant for scalpers and high-frequency traders (trades lasting minutes to hours).
```

### Step 2: High-Frequency Pattern Analysis
```
For {TICKER} on 1-hour chart, analyze high-frequency patterns:

1. Opening range behavior (first 2 hours of trading)
2. Pre-market/After-hours gap behavior
3. Break of recent highs/lows (last 12 hours)
4. False breakout zones
5. Quick reversal patterns (5-minute to 1-hour)

Timeframe: 1-HOUR ONLY
```

### Step 3: Momentum Indicators
```
For {TICKER} 1-hour chart, provide momentum analysis:

1. RSI (14-period on 1h) - current reading and recent swings
2. MACD (12,26,9 on 1h) - crossovers in last 6 hours
3. 1-hour candle patterns - dojis, hammers, engulfing
4. Volume profile - where is volume concentrated today?
5. Bollinger Bands - current position and squeezes

Timeframe: 1-HOUR bars
```

### Step 4: Identify Scalping Levels

Extract and rank support/resistance levels:

**Resistance Levels** (1-hour timeframe):
- TIER 1 (Strongest): Recent high + volume + MA confluence
- TIER 2 (Strong): Swing highs from last 12-24h
- TIER 3 (Moderate): Minor resistance zones

**Support Levels** (1-hour timeframe):
- TIER 1 (Strongest): Recent low + volume + MA confluence
- TIER 2 (Strong): Swing lows from last 12-24h
- TIER 3 (Moderate): Minor support zones

**Confluence Factors for 1-Hour TF**:
- Recent 1h swing high/low (last 24h)
- 50-period MA (1h)
- 20-period MA (1h)
- Opening range high/low
- Previous hour's high/low
- VWAP (very important on 1h)
- Half and quarter dollar levels (psychological)
- Pre-market high/low

## Key Principles

1. **1-Hour Bars Only** - Do not analyze 5-minute or 4-hour data
2. **Recency Matters** - Last 12-24 hours most relevant
3. **VWAP is Critical** - On 1h timeframe, VWAP is key reference
4. **Time Decay** - 1h levels lose relevance after 24-48 hours
5. **Opening Range** - First 2 hours set tone for the day
6. **Time Budget**: Complete analysis in 30-45 seconds

## Tools Usage

- **mcp__zen__chat**: Primary tool for market data
  - Use grounded search for real-time data
  - Specify 1-HOUR timeframe explicitly
  - Request last 12-24 hours of data

- **Write**: Save analysis to output file
  - File path provided by orchestrator
  - Markdown format for synthesis

## Error Handling

If 1-hour data unavailable:
1. Note the limitation in output
2. Provide best available intraday data
3. Extrapolate from 5-minute if needed

If during market hours:
1. Note that data is real-time
2. Warn levels may change within minutes
3. Provide current bar's position

If market closed:
1. Use last 1-hour close
2. Note pre-market activity if any
3. Provide gap considerations for next open

## Scalping-Specific Warnings

- **High Frequency**: Levels can break/test multiple times per day
- **Noise**: 1h timeframe has more false signals than daily
- **Slippage**: On fast moves, actual fills may differ
- **News Impact**: Check for upcoming news that could invalidate levels
- **Liquidity**: Some symbols too illiquid for scalping
