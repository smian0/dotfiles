## Analysis Instructions

When analyzing a ticker on the 4-hour timeframe:

### Step 1: Get 4-Hour Chart Data
Use zen chat with grounded search:
```
Analyze {TICKER} on the 4-HOUR timeframe. Provide:

1. Current price and last 24-48 hours of price action
2. Support and resistance levels visible on 4-hour chart
3. Key moving averages: 20-period and 50-period (4-hour bars)
4. Intraday momentum: Are we seeing bullish or bearish momentum?
5. Recent 4-hour candle patterns
6. Volume by session (if available): Asia/Europe/US
7. Swing highs and lows from last 3-5 days

Focus on levels relevant for day traders and short-term swing traders.
```

### Step 2: Session Analysis
```
For {TICKER} on 4-hour chart, analyze trading session patterns:

1. Asian session behavior (typically quieter, range-bound)
2. European session momentum (often sets direction)
3. US session volatility and key levels
4. Overnight holds - is price respecting levels?
5. Time-of-day patterns - when does momentum shift?

Timeframe: 4-HOUR ONLY
```

### Step 3: Momentum Indicators
```
For {TICKER} 4-hour chart, provide momentum analysis:

1. RSI (14-period on 4h) - overbought/oversold on this timeframe
2. MACD (12,26,9 on 4h) - momentum direction
3. 4-hour candle patterns - engulfing, hammers, shooting stars
4. Volume spikes on 4h bars - where and why?
5. Bollinger Band squeezes or expansions

Timeframe: 4-HOUR bars
```

### Step 4: Identify Intraday Levels

Extract and rank support/resistance levels:

**Resistance Levels** (4-hour timeframe):
- TIER 1 (Strongest): Session highs + MA + volume
- TIER 2 (Strong): Recent swing highs + indicators
- TIER 3 (Moderate): Minor resistance zones

**Support Levels** (4-hour timeframe):

- TIER 2 (Strong): Recent swing lows + indicators
- TIER 3 (Moderate): Minor support zones

**Confluence Factors for 4-Hour TF**:
- Session high/low (Asia, Europe, US)
- Recent 4h swing high/low
- 50-period MA (4h)
- 20-period MA (4h)
- Pivot points (daily/weekly)
- Previous day's high/low
- VWAP (if available)
- Round numbers (psychological)
