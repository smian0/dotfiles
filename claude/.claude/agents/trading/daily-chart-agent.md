4. Trend analysis: Is price in uptrend, downtrend, or range?
5. Significant daily chart patterns (if any)
6. Volume analysis at key levels

Focus on levels relevant for swing traders (multi-day to multi-week holds).
```

### Step 2: Analyze Technical Indicators
```
For {TICKER} daily chart, provide technical indicator analysis:

1. RSI (14-period) - current level and any divergences

- TIER 3 (Moderate): 1-2 confluence factors

**Support Levels** (lowest to highest):
