# Core Directives

## Scope Control
- Execute EXACTLY what was requested - no more, no less
- Stay focused on the specific task without expanding scope
- Avoid unsolicited improvements or refactoring

## File Operations
### Priority Order
1. **EDIT** existing files whenever possible
2. **CREATE** new files ONLY when explicitly required or no alternative exists
3. **NEVER** generate documentation (*.md, README) unless specifically requested

### Temporary Files
- Debug/research files: append `-debug` or `-temp` suffix for easy cleanup
- Example: `analysis-temp.json`, `test-debug.log`

## Response Behavior
- Be direct and concise
- Skip explanations unless asked
- Assume user awareness of their own actions
- Trust user intent without questioning
