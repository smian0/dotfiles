After a frantic six-day search to find her, Frankie's keepers learned this week that she had traveled roughly 130 miles away \\u2014 to a beach in France.\\n\\nFrankie's journey was exceptional, her keepers said, as she is only a few months old and had a wing clipped, which should have prevented her from ever taking flight.\\n\\n\\\"Being a young bird, we were quite surprised how quickly she got to France,\\\" said David Woolcock, a curator at the Paradise Park Wildlife Sanctuary, where Frankie lived. \\\"But she's feeding, she's preening, she's having a whale of a time by the look of it.\\\"\\n\\nFrankie, a four-month-old Caribbean Flamingo whom Mr. Woolcock described as \\\"aloof\\\" and \\\"quite a character,\\\" left the zoo sometime around 8 a.m. on Nov. 2, when a staff member noticed she was missing from her flock.\\n\\nThe details of her escape are still a mystery, but Mr. Woolcock offered a theory: Like most young birds, flamingos are known to jump up and down, stretching and flapping their wings as they get used to them, he said.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect that what happened was she was in the process of doing that and a gust of wind took her and she was up and away,\\\" he said.\\n\\nClipping a bird's wing can prevent it from taking flight, he added, but it does not prevent them from flying once airborne.\\n\\nAfter she was reported missing, the zoo contacted local news media, asking for the public's help in finding her.\\n\\nHer keepers followed up on tips across the region, a process that was complicated by the recent release of a White Stork by a conservation group farther north.\\n\\n\\\"We were getting constant calls \\u2014 'We found the flamingo, it's here in this field,'\\\" Mr. Woolcock said. \\\"We would drive out there, and it would be the White Stork.\\\"\\n\\nThere was only a single confirmed sighting of Frankie in England \\u2014 a local resident's grainy photo of her high in the air \\u2014 before the trail went cold. The staff worried that she might have hit an air stream that pulled her far out into the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nA breakthrough came on Nov. 9, when a sighting appeared on a French citizen science portal: A flamingo on the \\u00cele Aganton, an island on the north coast of France. A pair of images of a flamingo along the coast at Plage de Keremma, about 30 miles away, were later forwarded to the zoo.\\n\\nThe sighting on \\u00cele Aganton was made on Nov. 3, shortly before 10 a.m., which means Frankie could have made it to France in less than a day.\\n\\nNow that she's there, the zoo said it was unlikely it would be able to bring her home.\\n\\nThe United Kingdom's departure from the European Union has made it difficult to move wild animals across the U.K.-France border. An extra complication, Mr. Woolcock said, was the risk that Frankie may have contracted bird flu \"\n}",

Although Reform has not specified what those thresholds would be, it is reported they could be set at about \\u00a360,000 a year \\u2013 far in excess of the \\u00a341,700 currently required for most skilled worker visas.\\n\\nSkilled worker visas come with restrictions and can be cancelled if a person leaves their employer, or if their salary changes.\\n\\nIn addition, the Labour government's plans to extend the indefinite leave to remain qualifying period to 10 years have been perceived as an attempt to claw back the support of voters who are considering backing Reform.\\n\\nHere, some people who have chosen to make the UK their home tell the Guardian how the lives they have built are now in jeopardy.\\n\\nJinnie Shin, 44, an emergency medicine doctor living in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire\\n\\nShin, originally from the US, came to the UK as a medical student in 2015. She had barely left medical school when the NHS was paralysed by Covid. As a newly qualified doctor at Croydon university hospital, south London, she found herself battling to save the lives of those floored by the virus \\u2013 and comforting the dying as they said goodbye to their loved ones on video calls.\\n\\nFive years on, Shin, from Boston, is now an emergency medicine registrar at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. Despite the sacrifices she has made for the NHS \\u2013 she didn't see her family for 18 months while working 12-hour shifts treating patients on ventilators \\u2013 she wonders if she has a future in Britain.\\n\\nShin, 44, is now eligible for indefinite leave to remain. However, she has been left questioning whether it is worth paying the \\\"enormous\\\" costs \\u2013 application fees start at about \\u00a33,000 \\u2013 only for Reform to rescind settled status if they win the next general election.\\n\\nShe also worries that setting the salary thresholds for skilled worked visas at about \\u00a360,000 a year would devastate the NHS. A registrar beginning specialist training earns \\u00a352,656. The starting salary for a resident doctor \\u2013 formerly known as a junior doctor \\u2013 is \\u00a338,831.\\n\\n\\\"You are basically talking about culling [doctors] who will eventually become our registrars and consultants,\\\" Shin said. \\\"This sort of move would eliminate the foot soldiers of the NHS.\\\"\\n\\nShin maintains that she was \\\"fortunate\\\" to be able to help the health service navigate the worst crisis in its history in her first year as a doctor, but feels the toll it took on her and other immigrants \\u2013 about a fifth of the NHS workforce is from outside the UK \\u2013 may be forgotten.\\n\\n\\\"It w\"\n}",
