He also said affordability was a \\\"new word\\\" and a \\\"con job\\\" by Democrats.\\n\\nHe has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \\\"cheaters\\\" and \\\"pillaged\\\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead.\\n\\nBut grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \\\"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\\\".\\n\\nHe has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.\\n\\nBut the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \\\"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\\\".\\n\\nHe added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \\\"I don't think it'll be necessary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high.

The media buzz was huge, but Jan Suraaj failed to win a single seat, scraping only a sliver of the vote, as Modi's BJP-led alliance swept to power.\\n\\nFor all the attention Kishor commanded - often more than established leaders - the party could not convert visibility into votes. In India's febrile and deeply divided political marketplace, his debut, many believe, stands as a cautionary tale: breaking into the system is far harder than diagnosing its flaws from the outside.\\n\\nThe modern history of Indian politics bears this out.\\n\\nSince the rise of the regional Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1983, very few new parties have crossed the threshold of relevance. Those that have - from West Bengal's Trinamool Congress to Odisha's Biju Janata Dal - were breakaway factions of major parties, anchored in existing social bases.\\n\\nOthers, like Assam's Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) in 1985 or Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) decades later, rode on the back of mass mobilisation and political crises. Kishor's Jan Suraaj had neither. It was not born of a street movement, nor did it emerge into a moment of anti-incumbent fury. Despite its many problems, Bihar in 2025 appeared to be largely content with the status quo.\\n\\n\\\"There was no anti-incumbency wave - voters largely stuck to established political and social loyalties. Without a visible crisis or widespread dissatisfaction, Kishor's party never appeared a credible alternative, despite hard work and mobilisation,\\\" says Rahul Verma, a political scientist.\\n\\nJan Suraaj's debut in Bihar also contrasted sharply with most new Indian parties.\\n\\nWhile parties like the AGP, TDP and AAP grew from \\\"socio-political movements that already had deep emotional and grassroots resonance\\\", and AAP was born from a mass anti-corruption movement, Jan Suraaj was conceived as \\\"more of an intellectual and strategic project\\\" - a strategy-driven initiative to fill what Kishor called a \\\"political vacuum\\\", says Saurabh Raj of the Delhi-based Indian School of Democracy.\\n\\n\\\"The subsequent padayatra [a long, grassroots walk across the state to meet people] tried to turn that intellectual idea into a people's campaign. But it still lacked the organic, movement-based energy that typically propels new parties to relevance. In that sense, Jan Suraaj feels more like a 'designed political start-up' than a party born of agitation or uphe\"\n}",
