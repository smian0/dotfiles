The authorities are yet to release an official death toll.\\n\\nThe violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm, consensus and order for nearly six decades.\\n\\nDuring an address to parliament on Friday, President Samia urged prosecutors to consider reducing or dropping charges for individuals who may have been swept up in the unrest without fully understanding their actions.\\n\\n\\\"I am aware that many young people have been arrested and charged with treason. They did not fully understand what they were getting involved in,\\\" she said. \\\"As a mother and guardian of this nation, I am directing law-enforcement agencies, especially the DPP's office, to show leniency.\\\"\\n\\nSamia also called on political parties to meet and discuss how to conduct politics without causing harm to the country. She reaffirmed her commitment to initiating a new constitution-making process.\\n\\nThe protests, organised by young people, drew clear parallels with global Gen Z-led mobilisations against entrenched leadership and unresponsive governments.\\n\\nAnalysts say while the unrest was unprecedented for Tanzania, it was preceded by a tense political climate - marked by stalled reforms, years of simmering youth anger, power tussles within the ruling party and the sustained persecution of opposition leaders.\\n\\nIn the months preceding election day, the CCM government worked to systematically eliminate any credible competition, according to analysts.\\n\\nThe two main opposition leaders were blocked from standing in last month's poll - Tundu Lissu is in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds.\\n\\nDuring her first term in office, Samia's approach to leadership had been initially admired both at home and abroad as she allowed opposition parties to organise rallies and criticise the government without the fear of grave repercussions.\\n\\nShe had pledged to re-open Tanzania to the world t\"\n}",

The American resolution seeks to provide a mandate for an international stabilization force and a governing board. Arab countries, in particular, which are concerned with being seen as occupiers, have called U.N. support necessary for their participation in such a force.\\n\\nRussia, as one of the five veto-holding powers of the Security Council, could block the U.S. resolution. Its counteraction suggested that the Council could be heading to another showdown and stalemate over Gaza. The 10-point Russian resolution, among other points, calls for Palestinian statehood and does not mention the stabilization forces and the governing structure favored by the United States.\\n\\nChina, another veto-holding power, informed the United States and the Council that its position aligned with Russia\\u2019s, according to diplomats who asked not to be named because they were discussing sensitive negotiations.\\n\\nAnticipating the Russian move, the U.S. mission to the United Nations issued a statement on Thursday saying, \\u201cAttempts to sow discord now \\u2014 when agreement on this resolution is under active negotiation \\u2014 has grave, tangible and entirely avoidable consequences for Palestinians in Gaza.\\u201d\\n\\nTensions have been brewing all week between the United States and the 14 other members of the Council, including European allies and Algeria, the only Arab member, as proposed changes to the U.S. resolution volleyed back and forth in negotiations.

The policy is still being finalized.\\n\\nThe policy change is a major expansion of the administration\\u2019s push to crack down on immigration from countries that it says lack sufficient screening and vetting for official documents. The shift would make it more challenging for those who arrived in the country before the travel ban to remain.\\n\\nThe change is also the latest effort by the Trump administration to narrow paths for legal immigration. Last month, the administration cut the number of refugees it would admit to the United States this fiscal year, rejecting thousands of people fleeing war and persecution while reserving slots for mostly white Afrikaner South Africans.\\n\\nThe policy change comes after Mr. Trump in June signed a travel ban on 12 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. The ban bars travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.\\n\\nThe ban also imposed partial restrictions on citizens from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Citizens of those countries cannot enter the United States permanently or receive certain visas.\\n\\nMr. Trump said in June that the ban was necessary because a recent domestic terrorist attack \\u201cunderscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted.\\u201d He added that people from certain countries were at greater risk of overstaying their visas.\\n\\nThe administration gave some exceptions to the travel ban. People with existing visas would be exempt, as would green card holders, athletes traveling to the United States for the 2026 World Cup or the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and Afghans eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa program, which is for those who helped the U.S. government during the war in Afghanistan.\\n\\nA spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the agency would not comment on draft internal guidance.\\n\\nIn the draft documents, the agency said some countries might not share enough vetting and screening information.

Information about 111 individuals is included. They are not named but their referees are, sometimes with mobile numbers and personal email addresses. It was not immediately clear how long the data had been circulating online.\\n\\nMax Kohler, a 29-year-old computer programmer, discovered his data appeared in the leak on Thursday after one of the referees on his application was emailed by a stranger who had seen the data dump online.\\n\\nKohler found that it included his last salary, the name of his current employer, and names, emails and addresses of his other referees, as well as lengthy answers he had given to job application questions.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very disappointing and disillusioning,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou spend time putting in all this sensitive information, salaries from previous jobs, home addresses, and they don\\u2019t take care of this information, and have it floating around in public.\\n\\n\\u201cThey should take it down, apologise and there should be a report into how this happened and what they are going to do to ensure it does not happen again. It must be mistrained staff or process error.\\u201d\\n\\nThe number of data security incidents reported to the UK\\u2019s Information Commissioner\\u2019s Office (ICO) continues to rise. In 2022 there were just over 2,000 incidents reported per quarter; that has increased to more than 3,200 between April and June this year.\\n\\nKate Brimsted, a partner at the law firm Shoosmiths and an expert in data privacy, information law and cyber security, said: \\u201cA breach doesn\\u2019t have to be deliberate, and while the ransomware attacks get the headlines, the majority of breaches today are through error. It\\u2019s just as important to had checks and processes as part of organisations\\u2019 day-to-day practices. We are all fallible. It\\u2019s really hard work managing your own data. It is difficult and sometimes boring, but is important.\\u201d\\n\\nThe ICO, which regulates data protection in the UK, said: \\u201cOrganisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless it does not pose a risk to people\\u2019s rights and freedoms. If an organisation decides that a breach doesn\\u2019t need to be reported they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn\\u2019t reported if necessary.\\u201d\\n\\nA spokesperson for Tate said: \\u201cWe review all reports thoroughly and are investigating the matter. We have not identified any breach of our systems and wouldn\\u2019t comment further while the matter \"\n}",
