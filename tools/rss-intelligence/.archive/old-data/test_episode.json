The authorities are yet to release an official death toll.\\n\\nThe violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm, consensus and order for nearly six decades.\\n\\nDuring an address to parliament on Friday, President Samia urged prosecutors to consider reducing or dropping charges for individuals who may have been swept up in the unrest without fully understanding their actions.\\n\\n\\\"I am aware that many young people have been arrested and charged with treason. They did not fully understand what they were getting involved in,\\\" she said. \\\"As a mother and guardian of this nation, I am directing law-enforcement agencies, especially the DPP's office, to show leniency.\\\"\\n\\nSamia also called on political parties to meet and discuss how to conduct politics without causing harm to the country. She reaffirmed her commitment to initiating a new constitution-making process.\\n\\nThe protests, organised by young people, drew clear parallels with global Gen Z-led mobilisations against entrenched leadership and unresponsive governments.\\n\\nAnalysts say while the unrest was unprecedented for Tanzania, it was preceded by a tense political climate - marked by stalled reforms, years of simmering youth anger, power tussles within the ruling party and the sustained persecution of opposition leaders.\\n\\nIn the months preceding election day, the CCM government worked to systematically eliminate any credible competition, according to analysts.\\n\\nThe two main opposition leaders were blocked from standing in last month's poll - Tundu Lissu is in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds.\\n\\nDuring her first term in office, Samia's approach to leadership had been initially admired both at home and abroad as she allowed opposition parties to organise rallies and criticise the government without the fear of grave repercussions.\\n\\nShe had pledged to re-open Tanzania to the world t\"\n}",
