## COMPOUND CRISIS ALERTS

**HIGH**: Telegraph Media Group

- Cascade: 12 direct connections, risk=HIGH
- Rationale: Fast-moving media sovereignty crisis + well-connected network = compound national security risk
- Top cascade paths:
  * Telegraph Media Group → RedBird Capital (ownership bid withdrawal)
  * Telegraph Media Group → United Kingdom (government intervention)
  * Telegraph Media Group → China (national security concerns)

**MONITOR**: disinformation
- Velocity: Emerging threat consensus - 15 facts in 24h
- Cascade: 7 direct connections, risk=MODERATE
- Rationale: Emerging cross-democracy alignment + moderate connectivity = monitoring needed for policy coordination

## Emerging/Recurring Topics
- Emerging (new this cycle): Telegraph ownership crisis, disinformation consensus, newsroom resistance
- Recurring (3+ periods): BBC war coverage, media ownership concerns, democracy threats
