## PHASE 1: ANOMALY DETECTION

**Baseline calculations:**
- Mean: (10+8+7+6+6+5+5+4+4+3)/10 = 5.8
- Standard deviation: √(((10-5.8)²+(8-5.8)²+(7-5.8)²+(6-5.8)²+(6-5.8)²+(5-5.8)²+(5-5.8)²+(4-5.8)²+(4-5.8)²+(3-5.8)²)/10) = 2.1

**Z-scores:**
1. **Jeffrey Epstein**: (10-5.8)/2.1 = 2.0
2. **United States**: (8-5.8)/2.1 = 1.0  
3. **Germany**: (7-5.8)/2.1 = 0.6
4. **Israel**: (6-5.8)/2.1 = 0.1
5. **Valve**: (6-5.8)/2.1 = 0.1

No entities exceed the 3.0 threshold for anomaly detection.
