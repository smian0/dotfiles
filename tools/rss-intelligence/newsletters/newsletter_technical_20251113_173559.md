## INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT

The knowledge graph reveals a concerning trend toward political violence escalation, particularly in Western democracies. The Charlie Kirk assassination represents a potential inflection point for domestic political conflict. Concurrently, traditional geopolitical tensions (Russia-NATO, Middle East) remain elevated, with new diplomatic alignments emerging through Israel boycotts and UN condemnations. The convergence of these multiple flashpoints suggests increasing global instability in Q4 2025.
