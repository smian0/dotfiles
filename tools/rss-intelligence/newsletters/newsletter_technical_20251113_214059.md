# Phase 1 Enhanced Intelligence Brief - November 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Phase 1 metrics reveal critical insights beyond raw article counts.** While no extreme anomalies (z-score > 3.0) are present, we observe MEDIUM-severity anomalies in geopolitical hotspots. The Epstein network dominates with structural centrality, while Germany's military shift and Kenya-Russia connections represent emerging velocity patterns. Centrality analysis reveals Epstein as the primary bridge entity connecting multiple storylines.
