# Automatic Subagent Coordination Demo

I have a complex task that should automatically trigger multiple subagents:

**Task**: Create a comprehensive backup system for my dotfiles repository.

This task involves:
1. **Research component**: Understanding backup best practices, comparing different approaches (should invoke researcher subagent)
2. **Implementation component**: Writing scripts and configuration files (should invoke coder subagent)  
3. **Integration**: Combining research findings with practical implementation

Please analyze this task and automatically delegate appropriate portions to the researcher and coder subagents while coordinating the overall workflow. Show me how you break down the task and which subagent handles each piece.

The final deliverable should be a working backup solution with documentation explaining the approach and implementation.
