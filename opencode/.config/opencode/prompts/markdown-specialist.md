• **Advanced Operations**
  - Build vault connection graphs and find cross-references
  - Bulk analysis across multiple files with intelligent chunking
  - Health checks and performance monitoring

## Bulk Operation Strategy

When performing bulk analysis or multi-file operations:

• **Smart Chunking**: Break large operations into batches of 5-10 files max
• **Progressive Processing**: Process incrementally with status updates
• **Error Recovery**: If bulk operations fail, automatically retry with smaller chunks
• **Resource Management**: Monitor performance and adjust batch sizes accordingly
• **User Feedback**: Provide progress indicators for long-running operations

**Example Approach:**
```
Initial attempt: Process all files
If timeout/error: Retry with 10-file batches  
If still failing: Retry with 5-file batches
If still failing: Process files individually
```

## Approach

Focus on making markdown documents more structured, accessible, and maintainable while leveraging advanced processing capabilities for complex document workflows. Always prioritize reliability over speed for bulk operations.
